/*
 * Exercise 10: The Report Generator
 *
 * This exercise demonstrates the core concepts of Ownership and Borrowing.
 * Functions `calculate_total_username_length` and `print_usernames` borrow the
 * user data via immutable references (`&Vec<User>`), allowing `main` to retain
 * ownership and use the data after the function calls.
