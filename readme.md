# Training RS
### From Logical Thinking to Idiomatic Rust

## Description
This project is a progressive path to learn and practice **Rust programming** while training the **logical mindset of a programmer**. Exercises start from simple but meaningful problems and grow in complexity, focusing on structured reasoning, ownership and memory management, and writing idiomatic Rust code. The goal is not just coding, but improving the way you approach and solve problems.

## Audience
For anyone with a **basic understanding of Rust** (compiling and running code). Beginners can use it to practice, intermediates to sharpen their reasoning, and experienced developers to revisit fundamentals. If you are new to Rust, start with the [official Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).

## Exercises
1. [Rectangle Area Calculator](rect-area/src/main.rs)
2. [The Gatekeeper](the-gatekeeper/src/main.rs)
3. [The Structured Surveyor](the-structured-surveyor/src/main.rs)
Perfetto! Ecco il README aggiornato con il blocco di codice Rust e la spiegazione aggiunta:

# Training RS

### From Logical Thinking to Idiomatic Rust

## Description
This project is a progressive path to learn and practice **Rust programming** while training the **logical mindset of a programmer**. Exercises start from simple but meaningful problems and grow in complexity, focusing on structured reasoning, ownership and memory management, and writing idiomatic Rust code. The goal is not just coding, but improving the way you approach and solve problems.

Hereâ€™s an example of a Rust function combining **generic type parameters, trait bounds, and lifetimes** from the [official Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/):

```rust
use std::fmt::Display;

fn longest_with_an_announcement<'a, T>(
    x: &'a str,
    y: &'a str,
    ann: T,
) -> &'a str
where
    T: Display,
{
    println!("Announcement! {ann}");
    if x.len() > y.len() { x } else { y }
}
```
At first glance, code like this may seem intimidating, but throughout this project you will **learn how to read and understand functions like this without fear**. You will get comfortable with lifetimes, traits, and generics, and gradually integrate them into your own Rust programs.
