# Rust Training Journey

### From Logical Thinking to Idiomatic Rust

## Description

This project is a progressive path to learn and practice **Rust programming** while training the **logical mindset of a programmer**.
Exercises start from simple but meaningful problems and grow in complexity, focusing on structured reasoning, ownership and memory management, and writing idiomatic Rust code.

Each exercise includes:

* a short problem description
* a “Rust pill” explaining a concept
* hints and tips to guide your thinking

The goal is not just coding, but improving the way you approach and solve problems.

## Audience

For anyone with a **basic understanding of Rust** (compiling and running code). Beginners can use it to practice, intermediates to sharpen their reasoning, and experienced developers to revisit fundamentals.
If you are new to Rust, start with the [official Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).
